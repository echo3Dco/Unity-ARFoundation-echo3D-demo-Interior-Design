### Optimization
Optimize by comparing copy methods like:
http://code4k.blogspot.co.at/2010/10/high-performance-memcpy-gotchas-in-c.html
or maybe implement native (SIMD-based) copy methods.
copy values directly into unity buffer:
https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Mesh.GetNativeVertexBufferPtr.html
https://bitbucket.org/Unity-Technologies/graphicsdemos/src/6fd22b55d6a0c21f2a4d18629ba1b6c61d44ca23/NativeRenderingPlugin/UnityProject/Assets/UseRenderingPlugin.cs?at=default&fileviewer=file-view-default
Avoid negative scene scale (coordinate system translation), in case it causes trouble like shading errors.


Events:
meshes ready
materials/textures ready
animation ready
everything ready
Some loading progress maybe?

Load Strategy:
NoAnimation
Unsupported extension expected
Unsupported extension nice to have
Only parts loaded
Load texture failed
